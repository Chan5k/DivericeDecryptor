# DivericeDecryptor
A simple script to decrypt files that have been encrypted using the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library.
# Getting Started
To use the decryptor, you'll need to install the cryptography library:
  
    pip install cryptography
You'll also need to install the colorama library:
     
     pip install colorama
# Usage
Run the script in your terminal and enter the path of the encrypted file and the path of the file to save the decrypted contents to when prompted. The script will also ask for the Fernet key used to encrypt the file. If the decryption process is successful, the decrypted contents will be written to the file specified and a success message will be displayed:

     py decrypt-updated.py
